Homer is nervous about his new assignment and is determined to prove himself as a valuable asset to the team. However, things don't quite go as planned when Homer accidentally gets Scorpio to reveal weaknesses in his plan while out at the local bar.

It turns out that Scorpio is under a lot of stress and turns to alcohol to cope. Homer, who is a notorious beer lover, takes advantage of the situation and strikes up a conversation with Scorpio at the bar.

As the tension builds and the stakes become higher, Homer must use all of his skills and luck to bring Scorpio down and return to his family safely. Will he be able to save the day with his accidental discovery, or will his luck run out? Find out in "Homer's Lucky Break."
